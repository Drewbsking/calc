== Plan Sheet ==
When PCMS board are used we wil ahve our own sheets,

== Notes ==
*'''should''' not use humor!
*Must be less than eight characters long and three lines.

[[Changeable Message Signs]] to be included in ALL projects, unless Engineer says not to.  Messages must be in the plans.  Remember messages can only be eight (8) charters per line and three (3) lines per screen, and readable with either screen read first.

*RCOC DOES NOT USE
**'''SEEK ALTERNATE ROUTE in any signing or press releases.'''

== Location ==

== Messages ==
The '''pre-approved message''' are to be shown in the plans.  

The spec book may say:<blockquote>If message changes are necessary from those as included in the plans, the message changes shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval a minimum of 5 business days prior to displaying the message.</blockquote>If more messages are planned, please expand this section to include planned messages for the project.  A message plan for canceled work due to weather or last-minute change on the project should also be discussed with construction. All of the planned messages don’t need to be included but you should verify that you have a message plan for the number of boards that you have.

Use PCMS’s to warn traffic of upcoming and changing traffic control during the life of the project.  Obtain approval from the Engineer for all sign locations.  Where feasible, utilize existing permanent changeable message signs (DMS) to display project information in lieu of a PCMS.  PCMS should not be placed within a 0.5 mile of a DMS.  Verify with construction the number of PCMS included in the project, there should be anticipated messages for the PCMS boards included. 

Install PCMS’s and make them operational a minimum of 7 calendar days prior to the start of work, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.  Messages displayed on the PCMS’s must conform to MDOT’s policy on PCMS’s.  Notify the Engineer if displaying a different message then those listed below for the project.

'''<u>Do not leave PCMS’s with a blank screen within the clear zone of any roadway at any time.  Remove the PCMS or display flashing dots in each corner of the screen when there is no message to display.  Update the PCMS messages at the end of each work period to reflect current traffic lane restrictions.</u>'''


For PCMS boards, it is recommended to indicate the date and time for projects beginning in more than six days. For when the project is beginning within six days, use the day of the week and time to indicate the start time (and end time, if known).

See [[Abbreviations]] for more.

=== Unacceptable Abbreviations ===
Abbreviations should be used cautiously with prompts words as they can cause confusion when used in the wrong context.  For example, drivers interpret BLK as BLOCKED when it appears with LANE in the form LANE BLKD.  CHEM is interpreted by drivers as CHEMICAL when sued in the message CHEM SPILL.  The table below provides a list of abbreviations are easily misinterpreted.
